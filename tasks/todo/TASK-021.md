### 21. Contract Testing

**Task ID:** TASK-021
**Title:** Contract Testing
**Priority:** P3
**Status:** 🚀 Future
**Agent/Human:** AGENT

**Acceptance Requirements:**
- [ ] API contracts defined and documented with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Consumer contracts generated automatically from API specifications
- [ ] Provider contracts validated against consumer expectations with automated testing
- [ ] Contract testing integrated in CI/CD pipeline with automated verification
- [ ] Breaking changes detected early in development with proactive alerts
- [ ] Contract versioning implemented with backward compatibility guarantees
- [ ] Contract publishing and sharing mechanisms with consumer integration
- [ ] Contract testing performance optimization for efficient execution

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- [ ] Create: `contracts/` directory with contract definitions and specifications
- [ ] Create: `pact.config.js` (Pact contract testing configuration)
- [ ] Create: `test/contracts/consumer-tests.test.ts` (consumer contract tests)
- [ ] Create: `test/contracts/provider-tests.test.ts` (provider contract tests)
- [ ] Create: `contracts/pacts/` directory with generated contract files
- [ ] Modify: CI/CD pipeline for contract testing integration
- [ ] Modify: API documentation with contract specifications and examples
- [ ] Create: `scripts/publish-contracts.sh` (contract publishing script)
- [ ] Create: `docs/contracts/CONTRACT_GUIDE.md` (contract testing guide)

**Code Components:**
- [ ] Pact contract testing framework with comprehensive consumer/provider support
- [ ] Consumer contract generation with automated API specification parsing
- [ ] Provider contract validation with automated testing and verification
- [ ] Contract test automation with CI/CD pipeline integration
- [ ] API specification integration with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Contract versioning system with backward compatibility management
- [ ] Contract publishing and sharing mechanisms with consumer integration
- [ ] Contract testing performance optimization with efficient execution strategies

**Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Define API contracts for all endpoints with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Set up contract testing framework with consumer and provider validation
- [ ] Generate consumer contracts automatically from API specifications
- [ ] Validate provider contracts against consumer expectations with automated testing
- [ ] Add contract tests to CI/CD pipeline with automated verification
- [ ] Test contract failure scenarios with error handling and recovery
- [ ] Test contract versioning with backward compatibility validation
- [ ] Test contract publishing and sharing mechanisms with consumer integration

**Safety Constraints:**
- [ ] Use isolated contract testing environment to prevent production impact
- [ ] Monitor contract test performance to prevent resource exhaustion
- [ ] Handle contract versioning carefully with backward compatibility guarantees
- [ ] Ensure contract changes don't break existing consumer integrations
- [ ] Validate contract testing doesn't create security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use proper contract isolation to prevent test pollution
- [ ] Ensure contract versioning doesn't compromise system stability

**Dependencies:**
- [ ] Pact contract testing framework with comprehensive consumer/provider support
- [ ] Existing API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline infrastructure with contract testing integration
- [ ] Consumer application integration with contract consumption capabilities
- [ ] Contract publishing and sharing infrastructure with automated distribution
- [ ] API specification tools with automated contract generation
- [ ] Contract testing performance optimization tools and strategies

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Define API contracts for all endpoints with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Set up Pact contract testing framework with consumer and provider support
- [ ] Generate consumer contracts automatically from API specifications
- [ ] Validate provider contracts against consumer expectations
- [ ] Add contract tests to CI/CD pipeline with automated verification
- [ ] Implement contract versioning with backward compatibility management
- [ ] Set up contract publishing and sharing mechanisms
- [ ] Test contract failure scenarios with error handling and recovery
- [ ] Optimize contract testing performance for efficient execution
- [ ] Document contract testing procedures and best practices

**Contract Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Consumer-driven contract testing with automated contract generation
- [ ] Provider contract validation with comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Contract versioning with semantic versioning and backward compatibility
- [ ] Contract publishing with automated distribution and consumer integration
- [ ] Contract testing performance optimization with parallel execution
- [ ] Contract failure detection with early warning and proactive alerts
- [ ] Contract documentation with comprehensive specifications and examples
- [ ] Contract testing integration with CI/CD pipeline and quality gates

**Contract Coverage Targets:**
- [ ] API endpoints: 100% contract coverage required
- [ ] Request/response schemas: 100% validation coverage
- [ ] Error scenarios: 100% contract coverage
- [ ] Authentication/authorization: 100% contract coverage
- [ ] Rate limiting: 100% contract coverage
- [ ] Data validation: 100% contract coverage
- [ ] Version compatibility: 100% backward compatibility testing

**Contract Testing Benefits:**
- [ ] Early detection of breaking changes with proactive alerts
- [ ] Improved API reliability with comprehensive contract validation
- [ ] Enhanced consumer confidence with guaranteed compatibility
- [ ] Reduced integration issues with automated contract testing
- [ ] Better API documentation with living contract specifications
- [ ] Faster development cycles with automated contract verification
- [ ] Improved team collaboration with shared contract specifications
- [ ] Enhanced quality assurance with comprehensive contract coverage

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Define API contracts
- [ ] Set up contract testing framework
- [ ] Generate consumer contracts
- [ ] Validate provider contracts
- [ ] Add contract tests to CI/CD
- [ ] Monitor contract compliance

**Tools:** Pact or similar
