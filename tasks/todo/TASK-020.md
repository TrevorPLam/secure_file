- [ ] Test mutation testing integration and reporting

**Mutation Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Comprehensive mutator coverage with JavaScript/TypeScript support
- [ ] Mutation score threshold: 80% minimum for quality assurance
- [ ] Critical modules: 90% minimum mutation score requirement
- [ ] Test file exclusion: Exclude test files from mutation analysis
- [ ] Performance optimization: Parallel execution and caching strategies
- [ ] Reporting: Detailed mutation analysis and improvement recommendations
- [ ] Integration: Automated CI/CD pipeline integration with quality gates

**Mutation Score Targets:**
- [ ] Global threshold: 80% minimum mutation score
- [ ] Critical modules: 90% minimum mutation score
- [ ] Security modules: 95% minimum mutation score
- [ ] Utility functions: 85% minimum mutation score
- [ ] Test files: Excluded from mutation score calculation
- [ ] Configuration files: Excluded from mutation score calculation
- [ ] Documentation files: Excluded from mutation score calculation

**Mutation Testing Benefits:**
- [ ] Identify weak test cases with comprehensive analysis
- [ ] Improve test quality with mutation-driven development
- [ ] Enhance code coverage with meaningful test scenarios
- [ ] Detect dead code and unused code paths
- [ ] Validate test effectiveness and reliability
- [ ] Improve code maintainability and robustness
- [ ] Enhance developer confidence in test suite
- [ ] Provide quality metrics for continuous improvement
