# CloudVault Backlog

This backlog tracks follow-up work identified during sessions. Items are ordered by impact.

## Metadata

- **Purpose**: Track follow-up tasks and deferred work for future sessions.
- **Inputs**: Session reflections, testing gaps, and documentation needs.
- **Outputs**: Prioritized task list for promotion into TODO items.
- **Invariants**: Entries should be actionable, scoped, and avoid duplicates.

## High Priority

- **Confirm CODEOWNERS handles**: Replace placeholder GitHub teams in `.github/CODEOWNERS` with real org teams/usernames.

## Medium Priority

- **Dependabot reviewers**: Decide reviewers/auto-merge policies and update `.github/dependabot.yml` accordingly.
- **Performance test automation**: Add optional CI job for `test/performance/` runs once baselines are agreed.

## Low Priority

- **Add integration test templates**: Provide reusable fixtures/utilities in `test/fixtures/` to speed up integration testing.
